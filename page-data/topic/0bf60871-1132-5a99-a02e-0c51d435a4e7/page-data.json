About 87% of sepsis cases begin outside of the hospital.[^85]\n\nSepsis is the body's extreme and life-threatening overreaction to an infection.  The body attacks itself and can cause tissue damage, organ failure, amputations and death.[^87]\n\n\nSepsis symptoms are:\n\n- Fast heart rate\n- Fast breathing rate\n- Very low blood pressure\n- Fever or low body temperature\n- Pale or discolored skin\n- Extreme pain\n- Sleepy, confused or difficult to wake\n- Increase or decrease in white blood cells\n [^86][^87]\n\n<a href=\"http://youtu.be/sGXGGMloKFA\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\">Embedded content: http://youtu.be/sGXGGMloKFA</a>\n\nSepsis kills more people than breast cancer, prostate cancer and AIDS combined[^87]\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/AEGUCpxwAlE\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\">Embedded content: https://youtu.be/AEGUCpxwAlE</a>\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/GU2oiAczTq8\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\">Embedded content: https://youtu.be/GU2oiAczTq8</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/cypQFXPrQD4\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\">Embedded content: https://youtu.be/cypQFXPrQD4</a>\n\n__Post Sepsis Syndrome (PSS)__\nFifty percent (50%) of sepsis survivors suffer from PSS. PSS can have many symptoms and complications resulting in being readmitted into the hospital again. The cognitive issues that follow sepsis can be debilitating such as dementia-like symptoms and difficulty to focus caused from critically low electrolytes and blood clots, potentially depriving oxygen enriched blood from reaching vital organs, especially the brain. Following discharge, sepsis survivors need to be properly evaluated for the level of physical and occupational therapy. \nIf you’re fortunate enough to survive sepsis, you may be susceptible to becoming septic again. Sepsis survivors need to be monitored and reevaluated by doctors after discharge. For the next few months, severe sepsis and septic shock patients need to report any complications and have blood tests to monitor specific indicators. CRPs (C-reactive proteins) and inflammatory markers need to be checked. CMP’s (Complete metabolic panel) including Magnesium and Potassium levels need to be monitored. Sepsis wreaks havoc to the human body and once the immune system has been triggered, it can reoccur again with a less severe infection.\n\n[The Rory Staunton Foundation for Sepsis Prevention](https://rorystauntonfoundationforsepsis.org \"The Rory Staunton Foundation for Sepsis Prevention\")\n\n[Sepsis Fact Sheet from the CDC\n](https://www.cdc.gov/sepsis/pdfs/sepsis-fact-sheet.pdf)\n\n[Sepsis Alliance](https://www.sepsis.org/?tid=ptv_rellink \"Sepsis Alliance\")\n\n[^85]: Rhee C, Dantes R, Epstein L, et al.
