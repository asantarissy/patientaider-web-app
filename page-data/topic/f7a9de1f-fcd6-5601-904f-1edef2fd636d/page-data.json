It can come and go during the day. Delirium is not the forgetfulness of aging or dementia. In some people delirium can be reversed when the cause is known and treated.[^1]\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/CHA2Hzg5Kkk\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\">Embedded content: https://youtu.be/CHA2Hzg5Kkk</a>\n\n### Risks:[^1]\n- Dementia\n- Elderly patients\n- Antipsychotic drugs\n- Alcohol, sedatives or pain killers\n- Withdrawal from alcohol or nicotine\n- Surgeries\n- Depression\n- Infections\n- Impaired vision or hearing\n- Brain disorders like stroke or Parkinson’s disease\n- Medical illnesses\n- Dehydration\n- Thyroid conditions\n- Constipation or not able to urinate\n- Chemical imbalances like low sodium \n- Sensory deprivation\n- ICU admission\n\n### Symptoms:[^1]\n- Not thinking clearly\n- Can’t understand what is happening\n- Seeing or hearing things not there\n- Fearful that people are going to hurt them\n- Not paying attention\n- Unable to focus\n- Easily distracted\n- Slurred or rambling speech\n- Not moving or walking as usual\n- Sleeping changes\n- Memory losses\n- Incontinence\n- Not following directions\n- Withdrawn and quiet\n- Acting angry, frightened or ashamed\n- Difficulty reading and/or writing\n\n### Diagnosis:[^1]\n- Neurological tests\n- Cognitive tests\n- Physical tests\n- Blood, urine and other diagnostic tests\n\n### Prevention:[^1][^2]\n- Bring a complete list of prescribed medications, over-the-counter medications, and supplements. \n-\tMake a list of all allergies, doctors, pharmacy, and medical conditions.\n-\tAsk that necessary medical records be sent to the doctors who will care for the patient.\n-\tBring glasses, hearing aids (with fresh batteries), and dentures. \n- Bring a few small objects from home.

Speak calmly.\n- Give instructions for one simple task at a time. Don’t overwhelm them.\n- Avoid arguments\n- Help the patient walk often when it’s safe per the nurse & doctor. \n- Stay with the patient as much as you can. During an acute episode of delirium, family should try to be with the patient around the clock.\n- Speak with the nurse or doctor if new signs that could be delirium (confusion, memory problems, and personality changes) as soon as you can.
