This process is called intubation. The airway is attached to a ventilator (breathing machine).[^144]\n\nThere are 2 kinds of artificial airways:\n\n- An endotracheal tube is placed in the windpipe (trachea) by going through the mouth or nose.\n- A tracheostomy tube is connected to a surgical hole in the neck.[^144]\n\nMonitors measure the heart rate, breathing rate, blood pressure and oxygen level. It is recommended that the exhaled carbon dioxide level (ETCO2) is measured by capnography. Normal ETCO2 range is 35-40 mmHg.[^145]\n\nCommunicating with the patient is much more difficult, because the patient can’t speak unless they have tracheostomy tube with a speaking valve. Having an airway can cause anxiety, fear and discomfort for a patient.[^146]\n\nPatients can communicate by:[^146]\n\n- Writing on paper\n- Nodding or shaking head\n- Using hand or facial gestures\n- Pointing to letters, pictures or phrases on paper or a board\n- Texting\n\nAlert the nurse if:\n\n- The airway comes out\n- The patient’s monitor alarms go off\n- Increased breathing difficulty\n- Changes in breathing\n- The patient looks worse\n- The airway doesn’t look or sound right\n- Increased confusion\n\nComplications for patients on ventilators:[^147][^148]\n\n- Ventilator-associated pneumonia\n- Sepsis\n- Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)\n- Pulmonary Embolism\n- Lung damage\n- Pulmonary edema\n- Fluid overload\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/L1CRAruWMVE\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\">Embedded content: https://youtu.be/L1CRAruWMVE</a>\n\n## Prevention of Ventilator-associated complications:[^74][^75][^147][^148]\n\n- Help make sure the patient's back and head are always at least at a 30 degree angle.\n- Ask for a daily check of the patient's ability to breathe without the ventilator's help.\n- Ask about reducing the amount of sedation medication or a \"sedation vacation\".\n- Ask about mobilizing the patient\n- Tell the nurse if the patient slides down in the bed.\n- Watch for bed sores on the patient's lower back and buttocks\n- Use subglottic secretion drainage endotracheal tubes if patient will be on a ventilator more than 72 hours\n\n## Prevention of Hospital-acquired Pneumonia \n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/4rFjAmaDXlg.\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\">Embedded content: https://youtu.be/4rFjAmaDXlg.</a>\n\n[Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) Fact Sheet from the Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America\n](http://www.shea-online.org/images/patients/ENGLISH_SHEA_Brochure_on_healthcare_associated_infections.pdf)\n\n[Hospital-acquired Pneumonia Information from the National Library of Medicine](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000146.htm)\n\n[Mechanical Ventilation Information from the American Thoracic Society\n](https://www.thoracic.org/patients/patient-resources/resources/mechanical-ventilation.pdf)\n\n[Tracheostomy in Adults Information from the American Thoracic Society\n](https://www.thoracic.org/patients/patient-resources/resources/tracheostomy-in-adults-1.pdf)\n\n[What to Expect While on a Ventilator from the National Heart, Lung, & Blood Institute](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/vent/while)\n\n[What Are the Risks of Being on a Ventilator from the National Heart, Lung, & Blood Institute\n](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/ventilatorventilator-support)\n\n[^74]: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
